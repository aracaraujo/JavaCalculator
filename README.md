# Overview

This software is a basic calculator written in Java. I'm interested in backend such as Java and C++, so I wrote this
program to practice my Java skills. The interface is built in Swing. 

The software is a basic calculator that performs the four basics operation addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division.

# Development Environment

I'm writing this calculator in Java using IntelliJ IDEA as my IDEA.

The GUI that I'm using is Swing. This is my first time programming in Swing, and I'm enjoying a lot. I know that is a
simple GUI, but it was easy to learn and I enjoyed a lot.

# Status

The calculator is done. It will only perform one operation at a time, so if you're trying to run don't try to add
severa number in a row. Add two at each time.
