# Overview

This software is a basic calculator written in Java. I'm interested in backend such as Java and C++, so I wrote this
program to practice my Java skills. The interface is built in Swing. 

The software is a basic calculator that performs the four basics operation addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division.
