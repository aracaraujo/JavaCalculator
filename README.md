# Overview

This software is a basic calculator written in Java. I'm interested in backend such as Java and C++, so I wrote this
program to practice my Java skills. The interface is built in Swing. 

The software is a basic calculator that performs the four basics operation addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division.

# Development Environment

I'm writing this calculator in Java using IntelliJ IDEA as my IDEA.

The GUI that I'm using is Swing. This is my first time programming in Swing and I'm enjoying a lot. I know that is a
simple GUI, but it was easy to learn and I enjoyed a lot.

# Status

The program isn't finished yet. The four basic operations are working already, but there's some logic regarding the
track of results when performing operations after operations that still needs to be fixed.

# Future Steps

I'm not sure yet if I will add anything else besides finalizing some logic. The purpose was creating a basic calculator
to practice more of my Java skills and learn about Swing and after finalizing the logic it will be pretty more done.
