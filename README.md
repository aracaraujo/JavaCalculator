# Overview

This software is a basic calculator written in Java. I'm interested in backend such as Java and C++, so I wrote this
program to practice my Java skills.

The software is a basic calculator that performs the four basics operation addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division.

# Development Environment

I'm writing this calculator in Java using IntelliJ IDEA as my IDEA.

# Status

The program isn't finished yet. The four basic operations are working already though. The calculator class also keeps
track of the numbers that the user input and the results of the operations.

# Future Steps

Once the backend logic is completed I will add a GUI, Swing most likely, and build an interface for the calculator.
